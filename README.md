Testurself
================================

Testurself is a open source web application made with Yii2 and AngularJS by me, VÃ­ctor Arcas, to offer a friend
(and anyone who wants to create their own tests to whatever non profit purpose) a better way to study.


Why Yii2 and AngularJS?
-------------------

Nowadays, when I write this readme file, I'm working as intern in a Software Development Company who, mainly, developes web applications in PHP and Javascript. We use Yii2 for multiple projects, so I started this project to practice Yii2, but some weeks after I ask the leaders to start using AngularJS for a better UX (they want me to take care of the UX as the main frontend developer and I immediately start looking for a JavaScript framework to speed up this frontend development, ease my work and write better JS code), and after a bit insistence, they accept, and I decide to develope this application with a 100% Yii2 backend, but a 100% AngularJS frontend (at this time is rather only a 90% in AngularJS because of the usage of JQuery for sending http requests and using DataTables).

Why a tests application?
-------------

Just because my best friend ask me one time to teach him programming for do some practical scripting to help herself in his studies. When I ask him "like what" he tells me "like tests". So a few days after I decide to do a fast programming project with Yii2 (after knowing AngularJS).
